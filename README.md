# Youtube-clone
This project is a fully functional, front-end clone of YouTube, replicating key features such as video playback, search, user interface, and responsive design. Built to mimic the look and feel of the real YouTube platform, this clone serves as a learning tool for understanding modern web development, API integration, and UI/UX design principles.
